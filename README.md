# DataMiningProjects
Dimension reduction, Classification and Clustering (Data Mining). 
Image Classification using KNN, Centroid, Linear Regression and SVM. Implemented Cross validation to verify the classification with above methods for almost 40 classes and clustering the data using K-Means. Dimension reduction was achieved using F-statistics, Principal component analysis, Linear Discriminant analysis, Classical multidimensional scaling and Laplacian Embedding.
